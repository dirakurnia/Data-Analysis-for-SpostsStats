# Data-Analysis-for-SpostsStats
SQL for Data Science Capstone Project was offered by University of California, Davis in Coursera.

Hi, and welcome to my GitHub. Here I presented all of my codes that is made for accomplishing the project. Before you dive in
to my coding, make sure you already opened or read my Google Slides to see the the descriptions for this project and also all
the questions and hypothesis that I've been answered with the codes. In the uploaded IPython Notebook file, I used two programming languages throughout the project, those are SQL and Python. Mainly, I used SQL to get an intended table from the database, then I use Python to visualize or the table that has been created.

Here I drop the link for accessing my "read-only" Google Slides file regarding the project :

Thank you and feel free to ask if there's anything you want to ask about the codes that's been given.
